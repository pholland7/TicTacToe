# TicTacToe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game using IDLE in the Python Shell for a user to play against the computer that utilises a self-constructed algorithm to determine the computerâ€™s next best move based on win possibilities.
In the future, I hope to implement it on a virtual environment using Django and make the algorithm even more efficent in terms of code length.
To use, download the .py file and run the module in IDLE.
