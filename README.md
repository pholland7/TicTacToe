# Tic-Tac-Toe
Built a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python for a user to play against the computer that utilizes a self-constructed algorithm to determine the computerâ€™s next best move based on win probabilities.
In the future, I hope to implement it on a virtual environment using Django and make the algorithm even more efficient in terms of code length.
To use, download the .py file and run the module in IDLE.
